Studying Style
==============

Action Bias
-----------

*Action Bias* is the attitude towards how you are studying, working, even living.
The author first know this from the Amazon's culture and think it's the best
English phrase for the Chinese speaking: 知行合一, acting like what you know after
learnt better.

Having a quick peek on the contests samples, it's obvious that the short form
questions are relatively easy for Chinese students. The more difficult part is
the programming contest. Without enough exercise, it's not likely one can finish
the tasks including problem modeling, coding and testing in a limited time.

Through out this course, we keep the emphasize on problem solving and practices.
Knowledge of topics are summarized in each lecture and short questions are always
supposed to be finished in class time. The heavy tasks are homeworks you should
finished independently. The goal of this is having you reach the programming
skill level necessary for completing the real contests. So you need action.

Why English

This lecture also showed you how you can find more reading & learning resource

convention). The reference list is a good start point for anyone eager to learn
more.
