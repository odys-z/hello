Ex 1. Factorial
---------------

Implement a program that takes user's input, an integer and output the factorial
result.

In mathematics, the factorial of a positive integer n, denoted by n!, is the
product of all positive integers less than or equal to n:

:math:`{n!=n\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n-2)\cdot (n-3)\cdot \cdots \cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1\,.}`

For example,

:math:`{5!=5\cdot 4\cdot 3\cdot 2\cdot 1=120\,.}`

The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.
