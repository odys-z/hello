The online programming test::

    ADMINISTERING THE TESTS:
    The programming problem and the short answer questions are all administered
    online.  Students can be at any location.  The tests are graded by the platforms
    and the results sent to ACSL.  There is no requirement for advisors to grade
    tests or to report scores.  ACSL will still send a copy of the tests by email
    to all advisors.   The tests should not be shared with students prior to the
    students taking the tests online.

    TAKING THE TESTS:
    Students taking the short answer tests in all divisions must log on to the
    testing platform.  Prior to taking the actual test, students should do the
    practice problems and submit their answers so that they are familiar with the
    platform.  Students must provide basic information including an email address
    that exactly matches the email address the advisor provided on the Leaderboard.

    If the 2 email addresses do not match, the student score will not be recorded.

    The time limit for all divisions is 30-minutes except for the Classroom Division
    that has a 50-minute time limit. Answers must be submitted within those time
    limits.

    Students taking the programming part of the test must log on to the coding
    platform using the platform generated ID name that they received when they
    registered and did the practice problems.

    Students can be at any location.  The time limit for the programming problem
    is 3-hours.  The time starts at login and runs continuously until the 3-hour
    mark is reached. The code must be submitted prior to the 3-hour time limit.
